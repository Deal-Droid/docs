## Why Multi-Language Support Matters

### Sell Globally from Day One

You don't need to hire translators or train multiple teams. DealDroid automatically detects your customer's language and responds naturally — helping you expand to new markets instantly.

### Increase Customer Trust

Customers are more likely to buy when they can communicate in their native language. DealDroid makes every interaction feel personal and professional, no matter where your customer is located.

### Save Time and Money

Instead of building separate support teams for each market, let your AI sales agent handle all languages simultaneously — 24/7, without additional cost.

## How It Works

1. **Customer sends a message** in any supported language
2. **DealDroid detects the language** automatically
3. **Your Droid responds** in the same language, following your brand voice and sales strategy

> **Note:** DealDroid doesn't just translate — it understands context, intent, and cultural nuances to deliver responses that feel natural and persuasive.

## What If a Language Isn't Supported?

If a customer writes in a language outside our supported list, DealDroid will do its best to respond in English or will notify you to take over the conversation manually.

We're constantly expanding our language support. If you need a specific language for your business, [contact our support team](mailto:support@dealdroid.com) and let us know.
