Ready to give your AI Sales Agent its own personality? Sales scripts are like acting lessons for your Droid — they teach it how to respond naturally, confidently, and persuasively in different situations. The better your scripts, the better your AI performs!

---

## Why Sales Scripts Matter

When your Droid receives customer messages, it detects intent and searches your knowledge base for relevant information. But sometimes customers ask questions outside your product catalog, or the AI lacks the specific information needed to respond confidently.

**Sales scripts solve this problem.** They act as training examples that show your AI exactly how to handle specific situations — especially when information is missing or unclear.

Think of sales scripts as your AI's personality guide:

- 💬 **Sounds like your brand** — Every response feels authentic and on-brand
- 🎯 **Handles unique situations** — From customer objections to off-topic questions
- 🧠 **Reduces confusion** — Clear examples prevent the AI from making up answers
- ✨ **Creates memorable interactions** — A strong personality builds customer trust

## How Your AI Uses Sales Scripts

![Sales Script interface](@/assets/general/salescript.jpeg)

You can access sales scripts from **Sales Scripts** in the left sidebar of your DealDroid dashboard.

When a customer message comes in, your Droid:

1. **Detects the customer's intent** — What are they asking about?
2. **Searches for matching scripts** — Do we have a relevant example?
3. **Adapts the script naturally** — Blends it with product knowledge and company info
4. **Delivers a natural response** — Sounds like a real person, not a robot!

## How to Write Sales Scripts

Sales scripts use a simple format in a single text area. The recommended structure is:

```
[situation description]
customer: [customer question]
admin: [your response]
```

**Key points:**

- **Situation (optional):** Briefly describe the scenario to add context
- **Customer:** Write example questions or messages that trigger this script (you can include multiple variations)
- **Admin:** Write the response you want your Droid to follow

**Important:** Your AI uses this as a guide and adapts it naturally — it's not a word-for-word script.

### Simple Example

```
Customer asks if you are an AI.

customer: Are you an AI?
admin: Ha! Guilty as charged! 🤖 I'm your friendly AI shopping buddy, here to make finding the perfect items super easy and fun!
```

---

## Real-World Examples

Here are practical sales script examples you can use as inspiration:

**Example 1: Customer Asks About a Product You Don't Have**

```
Customer asks about a product not in the catalog.

customer: Do you sell grilled fish?
admin: Hey! 🐟 We don't carry grilled fish, but we specialize in premium pet food for cats and dogs.

If you're looking to give your furry friend some delicious nutrition, we've got some amazing options! What kind of pet are you shopping for today? 🐱🐕
```

**Example 2: Customer Asks If You're an AI**

```
Customer is curious if they are talking to an AI.

customer: Are you an AI?
admin: Ha! Guilty as charged! 🤖 I'm an AI shopping buddy designed to make finding the perfect pet food super easy and fun!

I'm available 24/7, I've got all your product info locked in my digital brain, and I actually love talking about pet nutrition. Think of me as your personal shopping assistant who never needs a coffee break! ☕️✨

So, what can I help you find today? Are you shopping for a cat or a dog? 🐱🐕
```

**Example 3: Customer Questions Your Existence**

```
Customer questions why they should trust an AI instead of a human.

customer: Why not talk to a real person?
admin: Great question! 😊 Here's the honest truth:

I'm available **24/7** — whenever you need help, I'm here. Real people sleep, take days off, and have limited hours. I don't!

I also have **instant access to all our product details** and can answer questions about pricing, ingredients, and feeding guides right away. No "let me check with someone and get back to you."

**That said**, if you'd really prefer to chat with a human team member, I can absolutely connect you! Just let me know what you need. 💙

So, what's on your mind today?
```

**Example 4: Customer Asks About Your Company**

```
Customer wants to know more about your company.

customer: Tell me about your company.
admin: Awesome question! 🌟 We're a passionate team dedicated to providing the highest-quality pet nutrition. We've been crafting premium pet food for over 10 years, and we're obsessed with what we do!

Every product is carefully formulated with real ingredients — no fillers, no shortcuts. We believe every pet deserves the best! 🐾

We're not just selling pet food; we're supporting healthy, happy pets and the families that love them.

Got any specific questions about our products, or are you ready to find the perfect food for your furry friend? 🐕🐱

## Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Your Main Personality First

![bot personality settings](@/assets/general/setting_bot_personality.png)

Before writing sales scripts, define your AI's main personality in **Advanced Settings** > **Important Info**. Your scripts must align with this foundation.

> **Important:** If your main personality is "Professional Assistant" but your scripts sound like a "Shopping Buddy," your Droid will be inconsistent and confusing!

---

### 2. Cover Common Scenarios

Write scripts for questions you get repeatedly:

- **Off-topic questions:** "Are you a bot?", "Can I speak to a human?"
- **Products you don't have:** "Do you sell X?"
- **Objection handling:** "It's too expensive," "Why choose you?"
- **Brand story:** "Who are you?", "Why should I trust you?"

---

### 3. Keep It Natural and Conversational

Write like a real person talks:

- ✅ Use contractions ("I'm" not "I am")
- ✅ Sound warm and approachable
- ✅ Match your brand personality
- ❌ Avoid corporate jargon or stiff language

**Bad:** "I am an artificial intelligence designed to assist with product inquiries."

**Good:** "Yep, I'm an AI! 🤖 Here to help you find the perfect product!"

---

### 4. Always Guide Back to the Sale

After answering off-topic questions, redirect to products:

```
[Answer the question]

So, what can I help you find today? 😊
```

---

### 5. Update Scripts as You Learn

Monitor conversations and add scripts for:

- 🤔 Frequently asked questions
- 😕 Moments where the AI struggles
- 💡 New customer objections

---

## Testing Your Sales Scripts

After adding scripts, test them in the **chat preview panel** on the right side of your dashboard.

**Try these:**

- "Are you a bot?"
- "Why should I buy from you?"
- "What's your story?"
- Ask about products you don't have
- Type variations of your customer questions

This helps you:

- ✅ Verify your scripts trigger correctly
- ✏️ Fine-tune responses for better flow
- 🔍 Spot any personality mismatches
- 🎯 Ensure responses sound natural
