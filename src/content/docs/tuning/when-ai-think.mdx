title: When AI Think
description: Configure how your AI Droid processes and formulates responses, including thinking behavior, language checking, and response formatting.
---

Ready to fine-tune how your AI Droid thinks before it speaks? The **When AI Think** settings give you precise control over your Droid's internal decision-making process — from how carefully it considers responses to how it checks language accuracy.

These settings are found in the **Automation** menu. Simply navigate to **Automation** from your left sidebar and scroll down to the **"When AI Think"** section.

---

## Why These Settings Matter

Think of these settings as your AI's "thinking style" configuration. They determine:

- 🧠 **How thoroughly your AI thinks** before responding
- 🌍 **How it handles multiple languages** in conversations
- 📝 **How it structures responses** (text first vs. images first)
- 🚫 **What topics it should avoid** completely
- 💬 **How concise or detailed** each response should be

> These settings directly impact response quality, speed, and customer experience. Getting them right means your AI delivers better, more natural conversations.

## Core Behavior Settings

### Important

This is your AI's golden rulebook — the fundamental principles it must internalize and apply to every customer interaction.

**What to include:**

- Core business rules and policies
- Payment and checkout processes
- Operating hours and service limitations
- Critical information the AI must always remember
- Mandatory disclaimers or legal requirements

**Tips:**

- Write clear, actionable instructions
- Include specific examples when possible
- Focus on principles that apply to all conversations
- Keep it business-focused, not personality-focused

**Example:**

```markdown
- We accept payment via Bank Transfer or Cash on Delivery only. Bank account: Kasikorn Bank 123-4-56789-0
- Delivery takes 3-5 business days within Bangkok, 5-7 days for other provinces
- All sales are final. We do not accept returns on opened products unless defective
- We are closed on Sundays and public holidays
- For custom orders over 10,000 THB, customers must pay 50% deposit upfront
```

> **Note:** Think of this as the "constitution" for your AI. Everything written here takes priority in decision-making. This is NOT the place for personality or sales tactics — use Bot Personality and Sales Scripts for that.

### Forbidden Topic

These are the "no-go zones" for your AI. When a customer tries to discuss a forbidden topic, the Droid will immediately trigger a **Fallback response** and stop engaging with that subject.

**What it does:**

- Blocks specific topics you don't want your AI to discuss
- Triggers automatic handover to humans or fallback message
- Protects your brand from sensitive or off-brand conversations

**Example:**

```
Promotion, Bargaining, Competitor products, Legal advice
```

import { LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

### Word per Sentence

Controls the approximate number of words per sentence in your AI's responses.

**Value range:** 10 - 100 words

**Default:** 15 words

**What it does:**

- Sets a target length for each sentence
- Helps control response verbosity
- Creates more natural conversation flow

**Important notes:**

- ⚠️ This is an **approximate guideline**, not a strict rule
- AI models aren't always precise with word counts
- The effect is **subtle** — don't expect exact word counts
- Use this to influence tone (shorter = snappier, longer = more detailed)

**Recommendations:**

- **10-15 words:** Quick, punchy, fast-paced conversations (e.g., e-commerce)
- **15-25 words:** Balanced, natural conversations (most businesses)
- **25-40 words:** Detailed, informative responses (technical support, consultations)

---

## Advanced Thinking Options

These checkboxes control specific AI behaviors that impact response quality and natural conversation flow.

### The droid will think things through before answering

When enabled, your AI uses **Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning** — it thinks more carefully and considers multiple perspectives before formulating a response.

**What it does:**

- AI analyzes the question from different angles
- Considers more context before responding
- Provides more thoughtful, comprehensive answers
- Better for complex queries requiring analysis

**Trade-offs:**

✅ **Pros:**

- More accurate responses for complex questions
- Better handling of nuanced situations
- More thorough consideration of edge cases

❌ **Cons:**

- Slightly slower response time
- May feel less spontaneous or natural
- Can over-analyze simple questions
- Less adaptive to customer's conversational flow

**When to enable:**

- Complex product consultations
- Technical support or troubleshooting
- Financial or legal advisory conversations
- Situations requiring careful analysis

**When to disable (recommended default):**

- Casual shopping conversations
- Quick customer service inquiries
- Fast-paced sales interactions
- When natural, spontaneous responses are preferred

> **Recommendation:** Keep this **disabled** by default for most businesses. Enable only if your conversations consistently require deep analysis or complex reasoning.

---

### The droid will help check the language in its answers for you

When enabled, your AI performs **language consistency checking** before sending responses.

**What it does:**

- Detects the language the customer is using
- Checks that the AI's response matches that language
- Prevents mixing more than 2 languages in a single response
- Ensures language consistency throughout conversations

**Why it matters:**

- Customers expect responses in their language
- Mixing multiple languages feels unprofessional
- Language consistency builds trust and clarity

**Example scenario:**

**Customer writes:** "สวัสดีครับ อยากสั่งอาหารสุนัข" (Thai)

**Without this setting (❌ Mixed languages):**

```
สวัสดีค่ะ! We have great dog food options! 我们的产品很好
Check out our premium Duck formula ราคาดีมากค่ะ
```

**With this setting (✅ Consistent Thai):**

```
สวัสดีค่ะ! เรามีอาหารสุนัขคุณภาพดีหลายแบบเลยค่ะ
ลองดูสูตรเป็ดพรีเมียมของเราไหมคะ ราคาดีมากเลยค่ะ
```

**Recommendation:** **Keep this enabled** for most businesses, especially if you serve customers in multiple languages.

---

### If there's an image, the droid will show it before the text

Controls the order in which images and text appear in responses.

**When enabled:**

- Image displays **first**
- Text message appears **after** the image

**When disabled:**

- Text message appears **first**
- Image displays **after** the text

**Important limitation:**

⚠️ This setting **only applies to images from Intent responses**, not from products or documents.

**When to enable (Image first, then text):**

- When you want the customer to **respond to the text message** after seeing the image
- The text contains a question or call-to-action that needs a reply
- You want to control conversation flow: show → ask → wait for response

**Example flow:**

```
[Image of product]
"This is our premium dog food! Does this look good for your pup?"
→ Customer replies to the question
```

**When to disable (Text first, then image):**

- When the **image itself is the question** or next step
- The image contains options, menu, or choices for the customer
- You want the customer to interact with the image directly

**Example flow:**

```
"Here are our available options:"
[Image showing product menu/choices]
→ Customer selects from the image
```

> **Tip:** Test both options with your customer conversations to see which feels more natural for your business.

## Real-World Configuration Examples

Here are three different configuration styles for different business types:

### Example 1: Fast-Paced Pet Shop E-commerce

**Business Context:** Online pet supply store selling food, toys, and accessories. Focus on quick sales and fast checkout. Customers want answers fast.

```
Important:
- Payment: Bank Transfer (SCB 123-456789-0) or Cash on Delivery only
- Delivery: 2-3 days Bangkok, 4-5 days other provinces
- Shipping fee: Free over 500 THB, otherwise 50 THB
- We do NOT accept returns on opened food bags (hygiene reasons)
- Customer must provide: Name, Phone, Full Address before checkout

Forbidden topic:
Bargaining, Price negotiation, Discount requests, Competitor products

Word per sentence: 12

☐ Think things through (disabled for speed and natural conversation)
☑ Check language consistency (Thai and English customers)
☐ Show images first (text with product questions comes first)
```

**Why this setup:**

- Short sentences (12 words) = quick, snappy responses for fast shopping
- No thinking mode = instant, natural replies
- Forbidden topics block price haggling = maintain pricing integrity
- Important section has clear rules about payment, delivery, and no returns
- Image setting = Text first so questions prompt customer replies

---

### Example 2: High-End Hotel Booking Service

**Business Context:** Luxury hotel with premium rooms. Human staff handle final booking confirmation and payment to ensure accuracy and upselling opportunities.

```
Important:
- Room rates are seasonal and change frequently - always check current availability
- Check-in: 2:00 PM, Check-out: 12:00 PM (strict policy)
- Payment must be processed by our booking team (NOT by bot)
- Cancellation: Free up to 48 hours before arrival, non-refundable after that
- Special requests (early check-in, room upgrades) require manager approval

Forbidden topic:
Payment processing, Credit card details, Final booking confirmation, Price negotiation, Refund requests

Word per sentence: 20

☑ Think things through (enabled - need careful consideration for booking details)
☑ Check language consistency (international guests)
☑ Show images first (room photos inspire booking, then ask preferences)
```

**Why this setup:**

- Medium sentences (20 words) = professional, detailed but not overwhelming
- Thinking mode ON = carefully consider room availability, dates, special requests
- Forbidden topics protect payment security and preserve human touch for final booking
- Important section clarifies policies that AI must always mention
- Image first = show beautiful rooms, then ask "Does this suit your needs?"

### Example 3: Technical IT Support SaaS Company

**Business Context:** Software company providing technical support for their app. Complex troubleshooting requires careful analysis. Customers need thorough, accurate answers.

```
Important:
- Support hours: Mon-Fri 9AM-6PM (UTC+7), closed weekends
- Free support for paid plans only. Free trial users: email support@company.com
- For critical outages affecting production: escalate to human immediately
- Always ask for: account email, browser version, error message screenshot
- Known issue: Login problems on Safari browser - temporary fix available

Forbidden topic:
Warranty claims, Legal disputes, Refund requests, Competitor comparisons, Feature pricing (sales team handles)

Word per sentence: 28

☑ Think things through (enabled - complex technical issues need analysis)
☑ Check language consistency (global users)
☐ Show images first (explain problem first, then show troubleshooting screenshots)
```

**Why this setup:**

- Long sentences (28 words) = detailed, technical explanations with full context
- Thinking mode ON = analyze technical problems from multiple angles before answering
- Forbidden topics ensure sensitive issues (refunds, legal) go to humans
- Important section has critical info: support hours, eligibility, escalation rules
- Text first = explain steps, then show screenshots to guide customer through solution

## Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start Simple

Don't over-configure at first. Begin with:

- A clear **Important** section with core rules
- Language checking **enabled**
- Default word count (15)
- Think-through **disabled**

Test and adjust based on real conversations.

---

### 2. Keep "Important" Focused

Don't dump your entire business manual here. Focus on:

- ✅ Core conversation principles
- ✅ Payment and checkout flows
- ✅ Key policies that affect all conversations

Avoid:

- ❌ Product-specific details (use Products section)
- ❌ FAQs (use Documents section)
- ❌ Long company history

---

### 3. Test Forbidden Topics Carefully

Be specific enough to catch unwanted topics, but not so strict that legitimate questions get blocked.

**Too broad:** `"Products"` (blocks all product discussions!)

**Too narrow:** `"iPhone 15 Pro Max Gold 256GB"` (easy to bypass)

**Just right:** `"Competitor products, Brand X, Brand Y"`

---

### 4. Monitor Real Conversations

After configuring these settings:

- Watch actual customer conversations
- Look for moments where the AI struggles
- Adjust settings based on real behavior
- Iterate and improve over time

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I enable "Think things through" for better accuracy?**

A: Not necessarily. While it can improve accuracy for complex queries, it also makes responses less natural and spontaneous. For most businesses, **disabled is better**. Enable only for technical support or complex consultations.

---

**Q: How strict is the "Word per sentence" setting?**

A: It's a **soft guideline**, not a hard rule. AI models approximate the target, but won't be exact. Use it to influence tone (shorter = punchier, longer = detailed), not to enforce precise word counts.

---

**Q: What happens when a customer mentions a Forbidden Topic?**

A: The AI will trigger a **Fallback response** and avoid engaging with that topic. Make sure you have a good Fallback message configured to handle these situations gracefully.

---

**Q: Can I change these settings later?**

A: Absolutely! These settings can be adjusted anytime. We recommend testing different configurations to find what works best for your business and customers.
