Want to let website visitors chat with your AI Agent without leaving your site?

![Web Chathead icon and expanded chat window](@/assets/getting_start/web/icon_and_expand.png)

The Website Chathead adds a floating chat icon to the bottom-right corner of your website. When visitors click it, a chat window opens instantly — allowing them to ask questions, browse products, and get help from your AI Agent in real-time. No app downloads, no redirects, just seamless conversation.

Let's add your AI-powered chat widget in just a few minutes. 🚀

## Why Add a Website Chathead?

- 💬 **Engage visitors instantly** — Customers can ask questions without leaving your site
- ⚡ **24/7 availability** — Your AI Agent responds even when your team is offline
- 🎯 **Reduce bounce rates** — Keep visitors engaged with immediate answers
- 🛍️ **Boost conversions** — Guide customers through purchases right on your website
- 🎨 **Match your brand** — Customize the chat widget color to fit your site design

A website chat widget is one of the most effective ways to capture leads and convert visitors into customers. With DealDroid, you get the power of AI-driven conversations embedded directly into your website.

---

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- ✅ **Access to your website's HTML** — You'll need to add code snippets to your site
- ✅ A **DealDroid account** with at least one Droid (AI Agent) already created
- ✅ Basic knowledge of where to find your website's `<head>` and `<body>` tags

> **Note:** If you use a website builder like WordPress, Shopify, or Wix, you can usually add custom code through their settings panel.

---

## Step 1: Navigate to Channels and Create Website Embed

![Channels page with New Website Embed button](@/assets/getting_start/web/new.png)

1. Log in to your DealDroid dashboard
2. Click on **Channels** in the left sidebar menu (highlighted with arrow)
3. You'll see the "All Channels" page showing any channels you've already connected
4. Click the **New Website Embed** button (highlighted with arrow)

---

## Step 2: Configure Your Chat Widget

![Website Embed configuration form](@/assets/getting_start/web/form.png)

After clicking **New Website Embed**, you'll see a configuration form with the following options:

### Channel Name

Give your channel a memorable name to identify it in your dashboard.

- **Default:** "Web Channel"
- **Example:** "Main Website Chat" or "Product Page Widget"

> **Tip:** Use descriptive names if you plan to embed chat widgets on multiple websites or sections.

### Primary Color

Choose a color that matches your website's branding. The chat icon and header will use this color.

- Click the color picker to select your preferred color
- The color code updates automatically (e.g., `425067`)
- **The embed scripts update in real-time** as you change the color

### Enable Channel

Toggle this option to control whether your chat widget is active:

- **Enabled** — Your AI Agent will respond to visitor messages
- **Disabled** — The chat icon still appears, but your AI Agent won't respond

> **Tip:** Use the disable feature when you need to temporarily pause the chat without removing the code from your website.

---

## Step 3: Add the Code to Your Website

DealDroid provides two code snippets that you need to add to your website. Each snippet serves a specific purpose and should be placed in a specific location.

### CSS Stylesheet — Add Before `</head>`

Copy the CSS link and paste it inside your `<head>` section, before the closing `</head>` tag:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.css" />
```

**Why place CSS in the `<head>`?**

- CSS in the `<head>` loads before the page content renders
- This prevents a "flash of unstyled content" where the chat widget appears broken momentarily
- Your chat icon will look correct from the moment it appears

---

### JavaScript — Add Before `</body>`

Copy the JavaScript snippet and paste it just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script
  type="module"
  src="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_sample&color=425067"
></script>
```

**Why place JavaScript at the bottom?**

- JavaScript at the bottom of `<body>` loads after all page content
- This ensures your main content loads first, improving perceived page speed
- The chat widget initializes after the page is ready, preventing any blocking

---

### Complete Example

Here's how your HTML structure should look with both snippets in place:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your Website</title>
    <!-- Your existing stylesheets -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="your-styles.css" />

    <!-- DealDroid Chat Widget CSS -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your website content -->
    <header>...</header>
    <main>...</main>
    <footer>...</footer>

    <!-- Your existing scripts -->
    <script src="your-scripts.js"></script>

    <!-- DealDroid Chat Widget JavaScript -->
    <script
      type="module"
      src="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_sample&color=425067"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

## Why Two Separate Files?

You might wonder why we don't combine everything into a single script. Keeping CSS and JavaScript separate gives you more control:

- 🎨 **Style customization** — Override or extend the default styles with your own CSS
- ⚡ **Loading control** — Decide exactly when each resource loads
- 🔧 **Conditional loading** — Load the chat widget only on specific pages

### Example Use Cases

**Load chat only on product pages:**

```html
<script>
  if (window.location.pathname.includes("/products")) {
    const script = document.createElement("script");
    script.type = "module";
    script.src =
      "http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_sample&color=425067";
    document.body.appendChild(script);
  }
</script>
```

**Delay loading until user scrolls:**

```html
<script>
  let chatLoaded = false;
  window.addEventListener("scroll", function () {
    if (!chatLoaded && window.scrollY > 300) {
      chatLoaded = true;
      const script = document.createElement("script");
      script.type = "module";
      script.src =
        "http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_sample&color=425067";
      document.body.appendChild(script);
    }
  });
</script>
```

---

## You're All Set! 🎉

**Your AI Agent is now live on your website!**

Once you've added both code snippets and saved your changes, the chat icon will appear in the bottom-right corner of your website. Visitors can click it to start chatting with your AI Agent immediately.

Your AI will handle:

- 💬 **Visitor questions** — Answer inquiries about products, services, and policies
- 🛍️ **Product recommendations** — Suggest items based on visitor needs
- 🎯 **Sales conversations** — Guide visitors toward purchases
- 📞 **Support requests** — Handle common support questions automatically

---

## Testing Your Chat Widget

Want to make sure everything works? Here's how to test:

1. Open your website in a browser
2. Look for the **chat icon** in the bottom-right corner
3. Click the icon to open the chat window
4. Send a test message like "Hello" or "What do you sell?"
5. Your AI Agent should respond within seconds

If you don't see the chat icon:

- ✅ Check that both code snippets are added correctly
- ✅ Verify the snippets are in the correct locations (`<head>` and `<body>`)
- ✅ Clear your browser cache and refresh the page
- ✅ Check your browser's developer console for any errors

If the icon appears but you don't get responses:

- ✅ Make sure **Enable Channel** is turned on in DealDroid
- ✅ Verify that a Droid is assigned to this channel
- ✅ Check that your Droid has Knowledge Base and Products configured

---

## Regenerating Your Script

Need to generate a new script ID? Click the **Regenerate** button in the channel settings.

<Aside type="danger">
  Regenerating your script will **invalidate your current embed code**. Your
  existing chat widget will stop working until you update the code on your
  website with the new script.
</Aside>

After regenerating:

1. Copy the new CSS and JavaScript snippets
2. Replace the old code on your website with the new snippets
3. Save and deploy your website changes

> **Tip:** Only regenerate if you suspect your script ID has been compromised or you need a fresh start.

---

## Advanced Customization 🎨

Want to customize the chat widget's title, welcome message, or suggested questions? You can override the default settings by adding a `window.ChatHeadConfig` object before the DealDroid script.

![Chat widget showing customized title, welcome message, and suggested questions](@/assets/getting_start/web/config.png)

Here's how your code would look with custom configuration:

```html
<body>
  <!-- Your website content -->
  <header>...</header>
  <main>...</main>
  <footer>...</footer>

  <!-- DealDroid Chat Configuration -->
  <script>
    // @ts-ignore - Prevents TypeScript errors in IDEs
    window.ChatHeadConfig = {
      scriptId: "script_xxxxxx",
      title: "Ask DealDroid",
      openTitle: "How can we help you?",
      theme: {
        primary: "#4f46e5",
      },
      openQuestions: [
        "What is DealDroid?",
        "How to integrate DealDroid?",
        "Pricing details",
      ],
    };
  </script>

  <!-- DealDroid Chat Widget JavaScript -->
  <script
    type="module"
    src="https://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_xxxxxxx"
  ></script>
</body>
```

> **Important:** The `ChatHeadConfig` script must be placed **before** the DealDroid widget script to work correctly.

---

### ChatHeadConfig Fields Explained

Here's what each field does and how to use it effectively:

#### scriptId

**Required.** Your unique script identifier from the DealDroid dashboard.

- Must match the `scriptId` in your JavaScript URL
- Get this from your channel settings in DealDroid

**Example:** `"script_xaugxgesi6a"`

---

#### title

The text displayed in the chat widget header.

**Tips:**

- Keep it short and friendly (2-4 words)
- Make it clear it's a chat or help feature
- Use your brand name or product name

**Examples:**

- `"Ask DealDroid"`
- `"Chat with Us"`
- `"Pet Store Helper"`
- `"Coffee Shop Assistant"`

---

#### openTitle

The welcome message shown above the suggested questions when the chat opens.

**Tips:**

- Make it inviting and action-oriented
- Use a question format to engage visitors
- Keep it conversational and friendly

**Examples:**

- `"How can we help you?"`
- `"What are you looking for today?"`
- `"Need help finding something?"`
- `"Ready to order?"`

---

#### openQuestions

An array of suggested questions that appear as clickable buttons when the chat opens. Visitors can tap these instead of typing.

**Tips:**

- Choose 3-5 of your most common questions
- Make them specific and actionable
- Match the questions to your business goals
- Use natural, conversational language

**Examples:**

```javascript
// E-commerce store
openQuestions: [
  "What's on sale today?",
  "Do you offer free shipping?",
  "How do I track my order?",
  "What's your return policy?",
];

// Restaurant
openQuestions: [
  "What's today's special?",
  "Do you have vegetarian options?",
  "Can I make a reservation?",
  "What are your hours?",
];

// SaaS product
openQuestions: [
  "How does pricing work?",
  "Can I try it for free?",
  "What integrations do you support?",
  "How do I get started?",
];
```

---

#### theme.primary

The primary color for your chat widget (chat icon, header, buttons).

**Tips:**

- Use hex color codes (e.g., `"#4f46e5"`)
- Match your brand colors for consistency
- The widget automatically adjusts text color for readability

**Example:** `"#4f46e5"` (indigo blue)

> **Note:** Custom theme colors only work in light mode. In dark mode, the chat widget uses a neutral gray color scheme to match the system appearance.

---

#### theme.onPrimary (Optional)

The chat widget includes automatic accessibility features! If you choose a light primary color, the text automatically becomes dark for readability. If you choose a dark primary color, the text becomes light. This ensures your chat is readable for all visitors.

However, if you want to specify the text color yourself, you can use `theme.onPrimary` to define your preferred text color.

**Example:**

```javascript
theme: {
  primary: "#4f46e5",
  onPrimary: "#ffffff" // Force white text
}
```

---

### Real-World Example: Pet Store

Here's a complete example showing how a pet store might customize their chat widget:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Paws & Claws Pet Store</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Your pet store website content -->
    <header>
      <h1>🐾 Paws & Claws Pet Store</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Product listings, etc. -->
    </main>

    <!-- Pet Store Chat Configuration -->
    <script>
      // @ts-ignore - Prevents TypeScript errors in IDEs
      window.ChatHeadConfig = {
        scriptId: "script_pawsandclaws123",
        title: "Pet Store Helper",
        openTitle: "What can we help you find today?",
        theme: {
          primary: "#10b981", // Green to match pet/nature theme
        },
        openQuestions: [
          "What's best for a new puppy?",
          "Do you have organic cat food?",
          "Show me dog toys",
          "What are your store hours?",
        ],
      };
    </script>

    <!-- DealDroid Chat Widget -->
    <script
      type="module"
      src="http://happyhead.dealdroid.net/assets/index.js?scriptId=script_pawsandclaws123"
    ></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

With this setup:

- The chat header shows "Pet Store Helper" instead of a generic title
- Visitors see a friendly "What can we help you find today?" message
- The suggested questions are tailored to pet owners' common needs
- The green color (#10b981) matches the natural, pet-friendly brand theme

---

### Configuration Priority

**Important to know:** Settings in `ChatHeadConfig` will **override** the URL parameters.

For example:

```html
<!-- ChatHeadConfig overrides parameter to purple (#4f46e5) -->
<script>
  window.ChatHeadConfig = {
    theme: {
      primary: "#4f46e5", // This wins!
    },
  };
</script>

<!-- URL parameter sets color to blue (#425067) -->
<script src="...index.js?scriptId=script_sample&color=425067"></script>
```

> **Tip:** Use `ChatHeadConfig` for full customization, or stick with URL parameters for simple color changes.
