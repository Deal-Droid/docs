## Field mapping

| Field (DealDroid) | Found in LINE                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Channel Name      | Set in DealDroid                                             |
| Channel ID        | Messaging API → Basic settings                               |
| Channel Secret    | Messaging API → Channel secret                               |
| Webhook URL       | Copy from DealDroid → paste into LINE Messaging API          |
| Access Token      | LINE Developers Console → Messaging API → Issue (long-lived) |

<Aside type="tip">
  Keep `Channel Secret` and `Access Token` secure — do not share publicly.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting — common issues (short)

- Webhook not working: ensure `Use webhook` is enabled, `Webhook URL` is correct (https, no spaces) and saved
- AI not replying but messages reach DealDroid: check `Access Token` is correct/long-lived and inspect DealDroid Chat logs
- Wrong or unexpected replies: check Knowledge Base mapping and sales scripts in DealDroid
- Can't create/copy Channel Secret or Token: check account permissions (admin rights in Provider may be required)
- Duplicate auto-responses: disable LINE Auto-response (In use) before testing

<Aside type="danger">
  If you suspect your Token/Secret are compromised, regenerate the token
  immediately and update DealDroid for security.
</Aside>

## Next steps

- Test from multiple numbers/devices to cover edge cases
- Add Knowledge Base content and products so the Droid can answer business questions and recommend items
- If issues persist, collect screenshots and logs and contact the DealDroid team for support

You're all set — your AI Sales Agent is ready on LINE OA 🎉
