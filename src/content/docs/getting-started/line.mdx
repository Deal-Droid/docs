Ready to let your AI Agent handle customer chats on LINE?

Connecting a LINE Channel allows your LINE Official Account to send customer conversations to DealDroid. Unlike Facebook, the integration process requires a bit more setup — you'll need to configure settings in the [LINE Developers Console](https://developers.line.biz) first, then bring that information into DealDroid.

Don't worry! We'll walk you through it step by step. 🚀

---

## Why Connect LINE?

- 💬 **Respond 24/7** — Your AI Agent handles every message on your LINE OA, even when you're asleep
- ⚡ **Never miss a customer** — Instant replies mean no one waits
- 🎯 **Sell around the clock** — AI presents products and closes sales automatically
- 📊 **Unified management** — See all conversations in one place inside DealDroid

---

## Connection Overview

Connecting LINE involves three main steps:

1. **Create a LINE Channel in DealDroid** — Set up a placeholder for your connection details
2. **Access the LINE Developers Console** — Log in to LINE's developer platform
3. **Exchange credentials between both systems** — Copy and paste the required information

Let's get started!

---

## Step 1: Create a LINE Channel in DealDroid

![LINE Channels Page](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_1.jpg)

1. Navigate to the **Channels** page, where all your connected communication channels appear
2. Click the blue **Create Line Channel** button to start creating a new channel

> **Note:** This page displays all your channels — both Facebook and LINE — in one place.

---

### Set Channel Name and Image

![Create LINE Channel Form](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_2.png)

1. **Channel Name** — Choose a memorable name like "Pet Store LINE" or "Downtown Branch LINE OA"
2. **Channel Image** — Upload a logo or representative image for this LINE OA

> **Tip:** Use clear, descriptive names so you can easily identify channels when you have multiple connections.

After entering the name and selecting an image, **don't click Create Line Channel yet!**
We need to gather credentials from the LINE Developers Console first. 👇

---

## Step 2: Access the LINE Developers Console

![LINE Developers Homepage](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_3.png)

1. Open [LINE Developers](https://developers.line.biz) in your browser
2. If you're not logged in, click **Log in** and sign in with your LINE account
3. Once logged in, click **Console** to access the management dashboard

> **Important:** You must have a LINE Developers account. If you don't have one yet, you can create it for free on this website.

---

## Step 3: Exchange Connection Credentials

Now we'll copy information back and forth between LINE Console and DealDroid. You'll need four pieces of data:

1. **Channel ID** — Your LINE OA's unique identifier
2. **Channel Secret** — A secret key for authentication
3. **Webhook URL** — The address where LINE sends messages to DealDroid
4. **Channel Access Token** — The key DealDroid uses to send messages back

---

### 3.1 Copy the Channel ID

![LINE Providers Dashboard](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_4.png)

1. In the Console, select the **Providers** or **Dashboard** menu to view all your channels
2. Click on the **LINE Official Account** you want to connect

---

![LINE Channel Basic Settings](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_5.png)

1. **Copy the Channel ID** displayed on the screen (it's a long numeric string)
2. **Paste it into the Channel ID field** in DealDroid

> **Note:** The Channel ID is located in the Basic settings section of your channel.

---

### 3.2 Copy the Channel Secret

![LINE Channel Secret](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_6.png)

On the same page, scroll down slightly:

1. Find the **Channel secret** section and click the button to **Copy** the value
2. **Paste it into the Channel Secret field** in DealDroid

> **Important:** The Channel Secret is confidential. Never share it with anyone!

---

### 3.3 Configure the Webhook URL

This step is reversed — we copy from DealDroid and paste into LINE Console.

![LINE Messaging API Settings](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_7.png)

1. **Copy the Webhook URL** from DealDroid
   > **Note:** Make sure the URL ends with your Channel ID number
2. Return to the LINE Console and click the **Messaging API** tab
3. Find the Webhook settings section and click **Edit** to open the popup
4. **Paste the Webhook URL** you copied from DealDroid
5. Click **Update** to save
6. **Enable Use webhook** by toggling it to Enabled (green)

> **Tip:** The Webhook URL is the address where LINE sends customer messages to DealDroid every time someone chats with your OA.

---

### 3.4 Copy the Channel Access Token

![LINE Channel Access Token](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_8.png)

On the same **Messaging API** page, scroll to the bottom:

1. Find the **Channel access token (long-lived)** section
2. If no token exists yet, click **Issue** to generate one
3. **Copy the token** that appears (it will be a very long string)
4. **Paste it into the Channel Access Token field** in DealDroid

> **Important:** This token is critical — DealDroid uses it to send messages back to your customers. Keep it secure!

---

### 3.5 Create the Channel

![DealDroid Create Button](@/assets/getting_start/line/pic_2.png)

After filling in all four required fields:

- Channel Name ✅
- Channel Image ✅
- Channel ID ✅
- Channel Secret ✅

- Channel Access Token ✅

Click the blue **Create Line Channel** button to finalize the connection.
