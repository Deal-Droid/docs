As your business grows, you may need extra hands to help manage your Droid. Whether it's updating products, adding knowledge, or monitoring conversations — teams make the dream work!

Good news! You don't have to do it alone. **Organizations** let you create groups of users who can access the same Droids. You can add multiple organizations to a single Droid, making it easy to divide responsibilities across your team.

For example, you might create:

- One organization for **customer support** — handling daily chats
- Another organization for **content management** — keeping products and knowledge up-to-date
- Another for **admins** — overseeing everything

The possibilities are endless!

## How Organizations Work

Before we dive in, here's what you need to know:

- 🏢 **Organizations are groups of users** — Team members belong to an organization, not individual Droids
- 🔑 **Droid owners control access** — Only you can decide which organizations can access your Droids
- 👑 **You're never locked out** — Even if another admin removes you from an organization, you always keep access to Droids you own
- 💼 **Only owners can manage subscriptions** — Organization members can't change your billing or subscription plans

---

## Step 1: Access Organization Settings

Start by navigating to the team and organization management area.

1. Go to **Settings** from your Droid dashboard
2. Locate **Team & Organization** under the Account section
3. Click on **Manage Organization and team member**

You'll be redirected to the Organization portal where you can create and manage your organizations.

---

## Step 2: Explore the Organization Portal

Welcome to your Organization hub! This is where all the magic happens.

The portal lets you:

- ➕ **Create new organizations** — Set up new teams for different purposes
- 👥 **Manage members** — Invite users and assign roles
- 🔄 **Switch between organizations** — Use the top navigation bar to jump between organizations you're a member of
- ✏️ **Edit organization details** — Update names and settings

---

## Step 3: Create a New Organization

Ready to build your team? Click **Create new Organization** to get started.

You'll be asked to provide a **globally unique name** for your organization. This is how your organization will be identified across DealDroid, so choose something clear and memorable.

**Tips for choosing a name:**

- Make it descriptive — "Acme Support Team" is better than "Team 1"
- Think long-term — Will this name still make sense as your team grows?
- Add a logo to the Organization to help you quickly identify what this Organization is for.

Once you've picked the perfect name, click **Create** and your organization is live!

---

## Step 4: Invite Team Members

Now that your organization exists, it's time to add people. After creating an organization, you'll be prompted to invite members via their email address.

### Understanding Member Roles

There are two levels of membership to choose from:

**Admin** — The organization leader

- ➕ Add or remove members
- ✏️ Change member roles
- 🎯 Manage organization settings

**Member** — The team contributor

- Access all Droids shared with the organization
- Edit products, knowledge, and settings
- Cannot manage other members

> **Choose wisely!** Admins have full control over the organization. Don't worry — even if another admin removes you, you'll always keep access to the Droids you own personally.

You can also skip this step and invite members later through the **Members** tab in the Organization Portal.

## Step 5: Grant Organization Access to Your Droid

Now that your organization is set up and populated, it's time to give your team access to your Droid.

Navigate back to your Droid's **Settings** page. You should now see the organizations you're a member of listed under the Organization section.

**To grant access:**

1. Check the boxes next to the organizations you want to share with
2. Click **Save** to confirm

That's it! Members of those organizations can now access and manage your Droid.

> **Remember:** Only the Droid owner can add or remove organization access. If you don't see your new organization listed, try clicking **reload** to refresh the list.

---

## Managing Organization Access Over Time

As your team evolves, you may need to adjust access:

- **Add more organizations** — Simply check additional boxes and save
- **Remove access** — Uncheck the box and save to revoke access
- **Change member roles** — Use the Members tab in the Organization Portal
- **Leave an organization** — Navigate to the Organization Portal and manage your memberships

## Best Practices

### Keep Your Organized

- 🏢 Create organizations by **function** (Support, Content, Admin) rather than by individual Droid
- 👥 Use **descriptive names** that make it clear who belongs where
- 📝 Document your organization structure for onboarding new team members

### Security First

- 🔐 Only grant access to team members who truly need it
- 👑 Limit Admin roles to trusted individuals
