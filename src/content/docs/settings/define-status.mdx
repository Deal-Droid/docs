description: How to set up and manage customer status to filter and prioritize customers effectively
---

Ready to manage your customers more efficiently? The **Customer Status** system helps you filter and prioritize customers intelligently, so you can focus your limited time on the most important customers first.

Ever had multiple customers reaching out at once and didn't know who to handle first? This system is built to solve that problem!

---

## Why Status Matters

- 🎯 **Clear prioritization** — Hot leads ready to buy should get attention before undecided customers
- ⚡ **Use time efficiently** — Admins with limited time can focus on customers with the highest chance of closing
- 💰 **Increase sales** — Attend to ready-to-buy customers on time, reducing chances they'll go elsewhere
- 📊 **See the big picture** — Know how many customers are in each stage of your sales funnel
- 🔄 **Automate workflows** — AI can assign status automatically based on detected intents

---

## Difference Between Status and Intent

**Intent** tells you **"what they're interested in"** (e.g., asking price, inquiring about shipping, wanting products)

**Status** tells you **"what stage of buying they're in"** (e.g., still uncertain, ready to buy, deal closed)

Example: A customer might have an Intent of "asking price" but their Status could be "Hot Lead" (if ready to buy) or "Cold Lead" (if just checking prices)

---

## Default Statuses and Meanings

When you create a new Droid, the system automatically sets up 5 default statuses:

### 👋 Greeting (Initial Contact)

**Customer just started showing interest** — Has initial awareness but hasn't decided anything yet, waiting for information from us

**Behavior:** Greeting, asking general questions, just browsing

**What to do:**
- Reply quickly
- Provide complete information
- Ask questions back to understand their needs

---

### ❄️ Cold Lead (Not Ready / Inactive)

**Not ready to buy right now** — Might be comparing prices with other stores or just checking prices for later

**Behavior:** Read but don't reply, slow responses, says "let me look first"

**What to do:**
- Don't be pushy, wait for the right moment
- Keep contact information
- Use follow-up or broadcast promotions to re-engage later

---

### 🔥 Hot Lead (High Intent / Ready to Buy)

**Customer has decided to buy 80-90%** — Just needs final confidence or payment steps

**Behavior:** Asking detailed specs, requesting payment info, trying to negotiate price, asking about shipping

**What to do:** ⚡ **Most urgent!**
- Summarize order clearly
- Push to close the sale
- Send payment information immediately
- Reply as fast as possible, don't let them wait

---

### 🎉 Closed Won (Deal Closed)

**Sales mission complete** — Moving to fulfillment and after-sales service

**Behavior:** Sent payment slip, provided shipping address, waiting for delivery

**What to do:**
- Thank the customer
- Provide tracking number and follow delivery
- Invite to join membership or community
- Build long-term relationship for future purchases

---

### 😴 Passed (Move On / Deal Lost)

**Customer not interested in buying now** — May have declined, looking for unavailable products, or not responding

**Behavior:** Declined, looking for products not available, no response for a long time

**What to do:**
- Thank them for their interest
- Suggest similar products (if available)
- End conversation politely
- Move to Archive to keep inbox clean
- Focus on other customers instead

## Creating or Editing a Status

![Add Status form](@/assets/setting/status_adding.png)

When you click **Add Status** or **Edit**, the system will show a form with these fields:

### Emoji (Icon Symbol)

**Used as a shorthand symbol** to help remember and distinguish when filtering statuses

**Examples:**
- 👋 for Greeting
- ❄️ for Cold Lead
- 🔥 for Hot Lead
- 🎉 for Closed Won
- 😴️ for Passed

**Tips:**
- Choose emojis with clear meanings
- Use different colors and shapes for easy recognition

---

### Label (Status Name)

**The name of the status** that will be displayed in the system

**Examples:**
- "Greeting"
- "Cold Lead"
- "Hot Lead - Ready to Buy"
- "Closed Won - Paid"
- "Passed - Not Interested"

**Tips:**
- Use clear, short, concise names
- Can use any language
- Add short description at the end if needed

---

### Color (Status Color)

**The color used to display the status** on Chat page and reports

**How to use:**
- Choose different colors for each status
- Use red or orange for urgent statuses (Hot Lead)
- Use green for closed deals (Closed Won)
- Use gray or light blue for non-urgent statuses (Cold Lead, Passed)

**Tips:**
- Colors help you notice faster, especially with many customers
- Use colors that match the meaning (e.g., 🔥 Hot = red, ❄️ Cold = blue)

---

### Option (Control Settings)

**Determines whether status can be downgraded by Intent or AI**

#### Meaning of Upgrade and Downgrade

Status order from bottom to top (or left to right) has these values:

- **Lower status** = lower value (e.g., Greeting, Cold Lead)
- **Higher status** = higher value (e.g., Hot Lead, Closed Won)

**Upgrade** = Change status to higher value (good ✅)
**Downgrade** = Change status to lower value (undesirable ❌)

#### How it works

Suppose a customer is in "Hot Lead" status and types "hello":

- Detected intent: "Greeting"
- This intent sets status to "Greeting"
- But "Greeting" has lower value than "Hot Lead"
- If set to **"Don't allow downgrade"**:
  - ❌ System will **not change** customer's status from "Hot Lead" to "Greeting"
  - ✅ Customer remains in "Hot Lead" as before

- If set to **"Allow downgrade"**:
  - ✅ System will change customer's status to "Greeting"
  - ⚠️ May miss customers about to buy

#### More examples

**Case 1: Protect Hot Lead**

Customer is in "Hot Lead" and asks "is shipping fast?"

- Intent: "Ask about shipping" → Status: "Cold Lead"
- Since Hot Lead > Cold Lead (Downgrade)
- System will **not change** to Cold Lead
- Customer stays as Hot Lead for admin to follow closely ✅

**Case 2: Allow Upgrade**

Customer is in "Greeting" and says "can I get payment info?"

- Intent: "Request payment" → Status: "Hot Lead"
- Since Hot Lead > Greeting (Upgrade)
- System will change status to Hot Lead ✅
- Admin can see immediately that customer is ready to buy

**Case 3: Manual Change**

Admin can always change status manually, whether upgrade or downgrade, by going to the **Chat** page

- Select the customer
- View customer details on the right
- Change status as needed
- The "Don't allow downgrade" option only applies to automatic changes by AI or Intent
- Admin maintains 100% control through Chat page

> **💡 Recommendation:** Usually should set to **"Don't allow downgrade"** for important statuses (Hot Lead, Closed Won) to prevent AI from changing customers about to buy back to regular customers

## Deleting a Status

### General case

When you delete a status with no customers using it, the system will delete it immediately

### Special case: Customers are using this status

If customers already have this status, the system will:

1. **Archive the status** — Won't delete immediately
2. **Hide from selection** — Admin can't assign this status to new customers
3. **Existing customers keep this status** — Until admin changes it
4. **Delete when no customers use it** — When no customers have this status anymore, system will actually delete it

### How to Restore archived status

1. Go to the same location where you deleted the status
2. Click **Restore** button
3. Status will be available for use again

> **⚠️ Important:** Before deleting a status, make sure you've changed all customers to another status first, otherwise you won't be able to delete it

---

## Auto-assign Status via Intent

![Intent list with edit button](@/assets/setting/status_intent_list.png)

Besides manually assigning status, you can have AI assign it automatically through **Intent**

### Step 1: Access Intent editing page

1. Go to **Tuning > Intent**
2. Select the intent you want to edit
3. Click **Edit** button

---

### Step 2: Assign Status in Intent

![Intent edit page showing Status to Assign section](@/assets/setting/status_intent_edit.png)

On the Intent edit page:

1. Scroll down to **Status to Assign** section
2. Select the status you want to assign when customer matches this intent
3. Save settings

### How it works

When a customer sends a message matching this intent:

1. AI detects the intent
2. System assigns the selected status to the customer automatically
3. **Condition:** Can only assign as **Upgrade** (according to Option settings)

### Usage examples

**Intent: "Request payment info"**
- Status to Assign: **Hot Lead**
- Result: When customer asks for payment info, system changes status to Hot Lead immediately

**Intent: "Not interested"**
- Status to Assign: **Passed**
- Result: When customer says not interested, system moves to Passed so admin knows not to follow up

**Intent: "Ask price"**
- Status to Assign: **Cold Lead**
- Result: When customer asks price but hasn't decided to buy, system assigns Cold Lead

> **💡 Tip:** Assign status to intents that clearly indicate buying readiness, such as "Request payment info", "Negotiate price", "Place order" should be Hot Lead

## Tips for Using Status Effectively

### 1. Check Hot Leads first every day

Start each day by filtering for **Hot Lead** and contact these customers first to not miss closing opportunities

### 2. Set up intents that indicate buying readiness

Assign status automatically for these intents:
- "Request payment info" → Hot Lead
- "Request shipping address" → Hot Lead
- "Ready to pay" → Hot Lead
- "Negotiate price" → Hot Lead

### 3. Use Cold Lead for follow-up

For Cold Lead customers:
- Save their information
- Wait 1-2 days
- Send promotions or special offers to re-engage
- Use broadcast messages to contact this group

### 4. Move Passed to Archive

When sure customer is really not interested:
- Change status to Passed
- Move to Archive
- Keep inbox clean, see only potential customers

### 5. Analyze data regularly

Check status statistics regularly to:
- Know how many customers are in each stage
- Find bottlenecks where customers get stuck
- Adjust sales strategy accordingly

### 6. Don't forget to update status manually

Even though AI assigns status automatically, you should:
- Check and correct if wrong
- Update when situation changes
- Use your own judgment
