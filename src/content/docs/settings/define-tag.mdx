Currently, tagging is manual, but an automatic tagging system is coming soon!

## Why Tags Matter

- 🏷️ **Organize customers quickly** — Tag customers to group them however you need
- 👥 **Collaborate easily** — Everyone on your team sees the same tags and knows who each customer is
- 🔍 **Search faster** — Filter customers by default tags to find who you need instantly
- 📝 **Remember easily** — Add meaningful tags to recall what's special about each customer
- 🤖 **Future-ready** — AI will be able to auto-tag based on the descriptions you provide

---

## Difference Between Default Tags and Custom Tags

**Default Tags**
- Pre-defined in Settings > Business Rules
- All team members can use them immediately
- Can be used to filter customers in Chat page
- Include descriptions to help the team understand when to use them

**Custom Tags**
- Can be added instantly without pre-configuration
- Perfect for specific, one-off cases
- Currently used for team communication only (not searchable yet)
- If you delete a default tag from Settings, existing tags become custom tags

---

## How to Set Up Default Tags

### Step 1: Access Business Rules

1. Go to **Settings** > **Business Rules**
2. Look for the **Tag Settings** section

---

### Step 2: Add a New Tag

When adding a default tag, you need to provide:

#### Tag Name
The name that will be displayed to your team and AI

**Examples:** `VIP Customer`, `Urgent`, `Follow Up`, `Interested in Cat Food`

> **💡 Tip:** Use short, concise names that clearly convey the meaning

---

#### Tag Description

The description serves two important purposes:
1. **For your team** — Helps team members understand when to use this tag
2. **For AI** — In the future, AI will read this description to automatically tag customers

**Examples:**

```markdown
Tag: VIP Customer
Description: Customers who purchase over $150 worth of products or buy regularly every month. They should receive special service and extra care.
```

```markdown
Tag: Follow Up
Description: Customers who are interested in products but haven't decided yet. Need to follow up with additional answers within 2-3 days.
```

```markdown
Tag: Urgent
Description: Customers who need products urgently or have issues that must be resolved today. Should respond as quickly as possible.
```

> **⚠️ Important:** Write clear and detailed descriptions because AI will use this information for automatic tagging in the future

---

### Step 3: Save the Tag

Once you've filled in the information:
1. Click the **Save** button to save the tag
2. The tag will appear in the default tag list immediately
3. All team members can now use this tag

---

### Step 3: Add or Edit Tags

When edit mode is open, you'll see:

#### Default Tags (at the top)
- Pre-defined tags from Settings
- Click to select immediately
- Can select multiple tags at once

#### Custom Tags (freeform)
- Type any new tag name without pre-configuration

- Perfect for special cases where you need to remember specific customer information

> **Note:** Custom tags are currently for team communication only and cannot be used for filtering or searching

---

### Step 4: Save

1. Once you've selected all tags, click **Save**
2. Tags will be saved and displayed in customer details immediately
3. All team members can see the tags

> **💡 Tip:** Everyone on your team can add and edit customer tags, regardless of who added them originally

## How to Filter Customers by Tags

### Use Filter in Chat Page

1. Go to the **Chat** page
2. Click the **Filter** button above the customer list (on the left)
3. Select the **default tags** you want to filter by
4. You can select multiple tags at once
5. The customer list will show only those with the selected tags

> **Note:** Filtering only works with default tags. Custom tags cannot be used for filtering at this time

---

## Tips for Using Tags Effectively

### 1. Set Up Default Tags Based on Actual Use

Design tags that fit your business needs:

**Example for a Pet Store:**
- `First Time Buyer` — New customers who haven't purchased yet
- `Regular Customer` — Loyal customers who buy frequently
- `High Value` — Customers who make high-value purchases
- `Need Follow Up` — Requires additional follow-up
- `After Sales Care` — Customers who've purchased and need post-sale care

---

### 2. Write Clear Descriptions

To prepare for AI auto-tagging:

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
Tag: High Value
Description: Customers who purchase products totaling $150 or more, or buy more than 3 items at once. Should receive special discounts and free shipping.
```

❌ **Not Good:**
```markdown
Tag: High Value
Description: Important customers
```

---

### 3. Use Tags with Status

Tags and Status work well together:

- **Status** tells you where the customer is in the buying process (Hot Lead, Cold Lead, Closed)
- **Tag** provides additional information about the customer (VIP, Urgent, Follow Up)

**Example:** A customer might have:
- Status: `Hot Lead` (ready to buy)
- Tags: `VIP Customer`, `Need Follow Up Today`

---

### 4. Communicate with Team Through Tags

Use tags to send messages to teammates:

- `@John - Please handle` — Assign to a teammate
- `Waiting for shipping info` — Waiting for shipping details
- `Price match requested` — Customer requested price matching

---

### 5. Clean Up Tags Regularly

- Remove unused default tags (existing tags will become custom tags)
- Merge tags with duplicate meanings
- Update descriptions to match current usage

---

## Things to Know

### Tags Don't Show in Customer List
Tags only appear in customer details on the right side, not in the All Chats list on the left

### Auto-Tagging is Coming
Currently, tags must be added manually, but in the future AI will be able to automatically tag customers based on the descriptions you provide

### Custom Tags Aren't Searchable Yet
The current filtering system only works with default tags. Custom tags are for recording information and internal team communication
